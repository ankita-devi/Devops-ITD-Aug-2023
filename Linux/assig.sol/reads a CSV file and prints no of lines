#!/bin/bash

while read l;do

done < "csv"


echo "here the no of lines in the file are $(wc -l csv | awk -F " " '{print$1}')"
#we can also this command to find the total number of lines  awk -F ";" 'END{print NR}' csv

#no of columns==  awk -F ";" 'END{print NF}' csv

#ANOTHER WAY======>

##!/bin/bash
#count=0
#while read line
